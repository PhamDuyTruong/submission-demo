- Technologies used:
+ Backend: Fastapi(python)
+ Frontend (ReactTS + Vite)
+ Database: MongoDB Atlas (integrated AWS)
+ Operation: Docker

- To operate this project there can be 2 cases:

1. Case 1: Do not use docker commands
   + Backend: execute command "uvicorn main:app" in terminal of folder      	"Backend"
   + Frontend: execute command "npm run dev" in terminal of folder 	"Frontend"

2. Case 2: Use docker commands 
   + Backend: 
	+ Step 1: execute command "docker build -t <name-app> ." in terminal of folder "Backend"
	+ Step 2: 
+ Step 2: execute command "docker run -d -p 8000:8000 <name-app>" in terminal of folder "Backend"
   + Frontend: 
	+ Step 1: execute command "docker build -t <name-app> ." in terminal of folder "Frontend"
	+ Step 2: execute command "docker run -d -p 5173:5173 <name-app>" in terminal of folder "Frontend"

- Notes:
Website still has many errors. Through the implementation, I have learned and learned a lot of useful knowledge about the backend (using Fastapi) and docker, I hope to be able to improve as well as learn more useful knowledge and the opportunity to become a part of member of the company.
